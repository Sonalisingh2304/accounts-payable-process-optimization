# Accounts Payable Process Optimization & Efficiency Analysis

## Overview
This project evaluates the efficiency of an Accounts Payable (AP) process using transactional procurement data.  
The goal was to identify payment delays, understand operational bottlenecks, and recommend improvements to improve cash flow control and vendor reliability.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze payment cycle performance
- Measure on-time vs late payment behavior
- Identify aging risk patterns
- Evaluate vendor exposure to delays
- Recommend operational improvements

---

## Methodology
1. Converted procurement records into a simulated payment lifecycle
2. Generated invoice dates, due dates, and payment dates
3. Calculated KPIs such as processing time and aging buckets
4. Built pivot dashboards to detect delay patterns
5. Interpreted operational and financial impact

---

## Key Findings
- Average payment cycle exceeded standard Net-30 benchmark
- Majority of invoices were settled late
- Delays concentrated in mid-term aging bucket (31–60 days)
- High-spend vendors exposed to payment risk

---

## Recommendations
- Implement automated approval workflow
- Introduce scheduled payment calendar
- Prioritize critical vendors
- Enable proactive due-date alerts

---

## Business Impact
- Reduced overdue invoices
- Improved supplier relationships
- Better working capital utilization
- More predictable cash outflows

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Analysis, Dashboarding)
